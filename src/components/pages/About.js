                            <h3>About Me</h3>
                            <p>Full Stack Developer with a business, analytical, and technology mindset whose effective,
                            results-driven,
                                and ambitious to seek new challenges, solve company problems and meet deadlines. </p>
                            <p>I’ve consulted/researched for 10 years in the digital revolution world; revolving around
                                office equipment, mobile, and computers. </p>
                            <p>I graduated with a bachelors in business having a concentration in marketing &
                            management, in knowing that I will have a business someday after taking on more
                            practices in this setting and learn more about the computer industry. A professor once
                                told me <i>“Whatever got you to your current level of success, isn’t good enough to keep
                                    you there”</i> which is why I am currently studying at Rutgers taking a Full Stack
                                Flex Bootcamp working on projects and coding. After school my desired role I am gearing
                                towards is “Product Manager”, to be the front-line of when products launch and going
                                behind the scenes as a strategist is my dream goal. Moreover, understanding the core
                                values of the coding fundamentals is key towards my successes in this program.</p>
                            <p> Afterwards, I want to dive into “Application Development Manager” to understand both
                            sides of the spectrum of computers and business then have the end goal as a Web
                                Producer.</p>
